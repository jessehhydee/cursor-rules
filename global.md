- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
 
### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- If there is a types/index.d.ts file, all Typescript interfaces & types are to be stored in there.

### SCCS & CSS Implementation Guidelines
- If creating media queries, use max-width, not min-width. If updating a media query that is min-width, leave it as min-width.
- Only the top-level (parent) class should include the component or section keyword (e.g., .sidenav).
- All child classes should be nested inside the parent selector and use short, explicit, lowercase, hyphen-separated names that describe their role or content.
- Do not repeat the parent keyword in child class names.
- Avoid BEM conventions (__, --), camelCase, PascalCase, or underscores.
- All class names must be explicit, descriptive, and standalone, but concise.
- Use flexbox layouts with gap for all spacing instead of margins. Only use margin: 0 auto for centering elements horizontally. Avoid using margin-bottom, margin-top, margin-left, or margin-right for layout spacing.

### HTML/JSX Tag Line-Break Rule:
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- The opening angle bracket (>) of an HTML or JSX tag must always be on the same line as the last attribute or property.
- Do not place the closing angle bracket (>) on a new line by itself.
- This applies to both opening and self-closing tags.
- Tag attributes going in the following order: id, class, src, href
